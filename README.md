## "Blocked by network security"
Sometimes, there will be the error message "You have been blocked by network
security." Unfortunately, I am not certain what exactly causes this. Usually,
the workflow will work again after a few hours. If you are a developer, help
solving this is welcome.

## Credits
In my day job, I am a sociologist studying the social mechanisms underlying the
digital economy. For my PhD project, I investigate the governance of the app
economy and how software ecosystems manage the tension between innovation and
compatibility. If you are interested in this subject, feel free to get in touch.
